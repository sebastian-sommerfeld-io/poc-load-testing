# PoC Load Testing

This project is a PoC for Load Testing with [Gatling](https://gatling.io).

[file-issues]: https://github.com/sebastian-sommerfeld-io/poc-load-testing/issues

This project is based on the [Kotlin template](https://github.com/gatling/gatling-maven-plugin-demo-kotlin) for Gatling simulations.io).

## Usage
When starting the gatling service, the System Under Test which is a dockerized [Spring PetClinic](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic) application will be started as well to run tests against locally.

```bash
docker compose up gatling
```

For instructions on writing Gatling simulations, refer to the Gatling documentation:
